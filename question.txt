 There is a tickets table in a SQLite database that has columns type, units, and price. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket.

    type	units	price
    silver	422	1.26
    GOLD	400	0.63
    GOLD	460	0.9
    GOLD	487	1.25
    BRONZE	395	0.74
    ...
    What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it.
    Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.
